## The Problem
Teen depression is a serious mental health problem that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. It affects how your teenager thinks, feels and behaves, and it can cause emotional, functional and physical problems. Although depression can occur at any time in life, symptoms may be different between teens and adults.

Issues such as peer pressure, academic expectations and changing bodies can bring a lot of ups and downs for teens. But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary feelings — they're a symptom of depression.Teen depression isn't a weakness or something that can be overcome with willpower — it can have serious consequences and requires long-term treatment. For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling.However, most of them are not able to convey their problems to anyone due to various reasons like embarrasment,nervousness etc and hence they suffer.

## The Solution
Our software, "SAMWAD," as the name suggests, solves this communication gap between the students and their mentors by maintaining their anonymity. Our idea is that every student in an institution should fill out the psychometric test, which will be in Google Forms format. The questions have been prepared after a lot of research and are evaluated using specialised algorithms that, with appropriate data collection, can be substituted using neural networks. Once the evaluation is completed, a detailed analysis and list of activities are provided to the respective teacher, along with a recommended list of movies, books, and music designed specifically to benefit the students' mental health in the long run.

The software generates a happiness score for each institution based on the survey they take from their students. This score provides a scale for judging various institutions on the basis of their comprehensive measures of the well-being of their students. So they will make every effort to be at the top of the rankings and hence adhere to practises beneficial for their students.

In a huge diversified country such as India,the classroom consists of students coming from various socio-economic backgrounds,our surveys also cover questions on discrimination and informs the concerned teacher that such a practice is taking place in the class.
